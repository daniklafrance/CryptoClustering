# CryptoClustering

## Description

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Getting Started

* Rename the Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb file as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.
* Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.
* Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

## Setup

* hvplot 0.8.4
* pandas 1.0.5
* scikit-learn 1.0.2

## Dependencies

* import pandas as pd
* import hvplot.pandas
* from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
* from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
* from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Grading

* Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data (15 points)
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data (10 points)
* Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (10 points)
* Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data (10 points)
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data (10 points)
* Visualize and Compare the Results (15 points)
* Coding Conventions and Formatting (10 points)
* Deployment and Submission (10 points)
* Code Comments (10 points)
